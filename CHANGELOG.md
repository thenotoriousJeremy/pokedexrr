# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.18] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- **Scanning died after ~67 cards** with `preprocessCard failed: undefined` / `scan-match failed: undefined`, permanently until the backend restarted. Root cause: the ORB verify loops (`inlierCount` in `scanMatch.js`, `inliers` in `setIndex.js`) leaked an embind `DMatchVector` wrapper (`knn.get(i)`) on every match row — it was never `.delete()`d. The opencv-wasm heap grows and never shrinks, so the leak ratcheted memory up (128 MB → 1 GB+) until `memory.grow()` failed and OpenCV aborted with a numeric error (hence the `undefined` message). Every subsequent OpenCV call then failed instantly, and since the backend process held the dead heap, restarting the app didn't help. Fixed by deleting the wrapper each iteration; the heap now stays flat.

### Performance
- **Set-scoped scan verification is now parallel** across a warmed worker-thread pool (`backend/src/scanPool.js`, `scanWorker.js`), each worker holding its own opencv-wasm instance. The independent per-printing ORB verifies are sharded across cores; results are identical to the previous single-threaded ranking (lossless). Measured on a 771-card set: **7079 ms → 2306 ms (4 workers) → 1457 ms (8 workers)**. Configurable via the new `SCAN_WORKERS` env var (default `min(4, cores-1)`, `0` disables). `matchSet` is now async; the pool is warmed at server startup so the first scan doesn't pay worker spawn + wasm load.
- Faster candidate feature loading in the global path: `readOrb` builds descriptor Mats via `Mat.data.set()` instead of `matFromArray(Array.from(buf))` (~53 ms/scan saved on 250 candidates; identical bytes).
- Worker threads no longer open a SQLite connection each: `scryfallApi`/`tcgApi` (which pull in the DB) are lazy-required inside the build/preview paths only, keeping the verify path DB-free.

### Diagnostics
- Opt-in `SCAN_RANK_LOG=1` appends one line per confident scan to `backend/scan-rank.log` recording where the winning card sat in the CLIP recall list — for measuring whether the global-path `RECALL_K` (250) can be lowered. Off by default, zero overhead.

### Storage
- Removed the category-map filing feature from the storage view (`showCategoryMap` / category-to-page filing) in `LocationManager.jsx`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-15

### Features
- Bulk-set condition and printing on selected cards from the collection long-press/select bar (`POST /api/collection/bulk` actions `condition` and `printing`).
- Split a total price paid for a pack or deck across cards into per-card `purchase_price` (`bulk` action `purchase_split`), weighted by market value or evenly, chosen at apply time. Integer-cent math keeps the parts summing to the exact total (`backend/src/utils/splitPrice.js`). Available in the collection bulk bar and the scanner's Recent Scans panel.

### Scanner
- Tap the auto-add countdown popup (Fast/Balanced/Accurate tiers) to pause and adjust condition/printing before the card is saved; ignoring it lets the normal auto-add proceed. Turbo remains instant.
- Quick-add fields: larger +/- quantity stepper; the rarely-changed Language field is dropped from the scanner quick-add.
- Tighter camera preview height on small screens.

### Storage
- Mobile filing: below 1024px, view the container detail and Unsorted queue one at a time via a segmented toggle; during filing the binder stays on screen (recommended slot blinks) with a compact pinned filing bar for Placed/Skip, and the view auto-follows the recommended slot.
- Custom (manual) container order is saved when all sort rules are removed; guidance text updated accordingly.
- Removed the Auto-Assign Categories action.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- Replaced `COUNT(*)` with `COALESCE(SUM(quantity), 0)` in storage capacity calculations across `collectionHelpers.js`, `compartmentSort.js`, and `storage.js`.
- Fixed N+1 database access loops in multi-quantity card creation (`POST /api/collection`) and bulk operations (`POST /api/collection/bulk`).
- Fixed serial loop in deck checkout allocation (`checkedOutAllocation`) using a single SQL `JOIN` query.

### Performance & Memory
- Implemented `withTransaction` atomic SQLite transaction management in `db.js`.
- Refactored physical container re-sorting (`POST /api/locations/:id/resort`) using SQL `CASE ... WHEN` batch updates.
- Added single-pass JSON metadata pre-parsing (`types`, `subtypes`, `color_identity`) in `compartmentSort.js`.
- Added composite SQL performance indexes for compartment lookups, location ordering, card search, deck checkout, tag joins, and audit log ordering.

### Features
- Added custom user tags system (`tags` master table & `collection_tags` junction table, `/api/tags` endpoints).
- Added storage capacity alert warnings endpoint (`GET /api/locations/alerts`).
- Added append-only audit logging & action revert capabilities (`audit_logs` table, `/api/audit-logs`, `/api/audit-logs/:id/revert`).
- Added saved filter presets (`saved_filter_presets` table, `/api/collection/filters/presets`, dynamic query builder).
- Added third-party CSV strategy import mappers and hygiene export mappers for TCGPlayer, Dragon Shield, and ManaBox (`csvMappers.js`, `csvExporters.js`).

### Scanner
- Added a Scan Detail slider (Turbo/Fast/Balanced/Accurate) trading speed for accuracy per scan: upload resolution, auto-capture cadence, server-side CLIP recall depth (`recallK`) and ORB feature count (`orb`).
- Turbo runs a fixed 2-second capture cadence with an on-screen countdown ring; the metronome holds while a scan is in flight so captures never overlap.
- Instant capture cue (click + vibrate + border flash) fires the moment the frame is grabbed.
- Added manual exposure control (shown when the camera track supports `exposureCompensation`).
- Duplicate-scan handling: dedup guard set before the add request; the resolved-duplicate skip clears when the card leaves frame or a different card appears; Cancel in the candidate picker stops auto-capture.
