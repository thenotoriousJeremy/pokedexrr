# CardDexrr 🎴

CardDexrr is a self-hostable, mobile-friendly full-stack web application for **Pokémon** and **Magic: The Gathering** card collectors. It allows you to identify your physical cards using your phone's camera, track real-time market valuations, organize card placements in physical binders and boxes, view rich analytics, and export your database for external trackers.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📱 Phone-Camera Image Identification**: Point your phone at a card and the server identifies it from the image — no typing. The pipeline auto-crops/deskews the card (OpenCV), recalls candidates with **CLIP** image embeddings, and confirms the exact card with **ORB** feature matching + RANSAC homography verification. Enter the **MTG set code** you're feeding and matching is scoped to that set (~300 cards) for exact-printing accuracy at one-tap speed. Works for both **Magic** (Scryfall) and **Pokémon** (Pokémon TCG API), with automatic game detection.
- **🔤 OCR Fallback**: When no confident image match is found (or for Japanese cards, which aren't in the image DB), it falls back to **Tesseract.js** OCR of the card name + collector number with fuzzy database lookup. Supports English, Japanese, and Vintage layouts with automatic name translation.
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard & Metrics**: Track total collection value, net worth trends (24H / 7D / 30D), average card value, holo print rates, energy type distributions (pie chart), rarity distributions, and set completion milestones.
- **🗺️ Real-world Location Coordinator**: Assign physical coordinate mappings to your cards so you can locate them instantly:
  - **Binders**: Maps by Binder Name, Page Number, and Slot (1-9). Features a double-page book view with 3D page-flip animations and multi-card slot stacking.
  - **Storage Boxes**: Maps by Box Name, Row ID/Letter, and Divider Section.
- **🇯🇵 Japanese Card Support**: OCR scans Japanese card names (hiragana, katakana, kanji), automatically translates them to English for API lookups, and displays them in their native Japanese names across the app.
- **💾 Universal Database Exports**: One-click downloads of your complete database in CSV (TCGplayer format compatible) or JSON.
- **🔐 Multi-User Auth**: Session-token authentication (opaque random tokens stored in a server-side `sessions` table, sent as a `Bearer` header) with admin controls for managing users and roles.
- **🐳 100% Self-Hostable & Portable**: Single-container Docker build with a local SQLite database that mounts to a persistent volume.
- **⚡ CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow to auto-build and publish the container image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm (v9+)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies for the root, frontend, and backend packages:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

### Running the App
Start both the React development server and the Express API server concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- **Frontend client**: `https://localhost:5173` (Runs over local HTTPS to allow camera access)
- **Backend API server**: `http://localhost:3001`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mobile Camera HTTPS Requirement**: Modern mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) restrict video camera access (`getUserMedia`) to **Secure Contexts (HTTPS)** only. 
> 
> To test on your mobile phone:
> 1. Connect your phone and computer to the same Wi-Fi network.
> 2. Open **`https://<your-computer-ip>:5173`** in your mobile browser.
> 3. Your browser will display a warning because the local developer SSL certificate is self-signed. Tap **Advanced** (or *Show Details*) and select **Proceed/Trust** (e.g. *Proceed to 192.168.x.x (unsafe)*). The app will load, and the camera will initialize successfully!

#### Alternative: Chrome Developer Flags (HTTP)
If you prefer not to use self-signed HTTPS in development:
1. Open Google Chrome on your phone.
2. Navigate to `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`.
3. Enable the flag and enter your computer's IP: `http://<your-computer-ip>:5173` (and port `3001` for container testing).
4. Relaunch Chrome. The browser will treat this address as secure, allowing camera access.

## 🔑 First-Time Sign In

On its **first startup**, CardDexrr creates a default administrator account and prints the credentials to the server console (the terminal running `npm run dev` / `npm start`, or `docker-compose logs`).

Look for these lines in the startup logs:
```text
Created default admin user. ID: 1
  username: admin
  password: <generated-password>
Log in and change this password immediately via Settings.
```

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**:
  - If you set the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable before first startup, that value is used.
  - Otherwise a random password is generated and printed **once** in the logs above. Copy it before clearing your terminal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The password is only printed on the run that creates the account (when the database is first initialized). If you miss it and did not set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, delete the SQLite database file so it is recreated on the next startup, or set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and recreate the database.

After logging in, open **Settings** and change the password. Additional users can self-register from the login screen (they are created with the `member` role); an `admin` can manage users and roles from the **Admin** panel.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Production)

CardDexrr is packaged as a single-container multi-stage Docker build, serving the compiled frontend directly from the Node server.

### Run with Docker Compose
1. Ensure Docker is running.
2. Run the following command in the root folder:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser. All database files are persisted in the `carddexrr-data` Docker volume.

### Environment variables (`.env`)
You can configure CardDexrr by passing these environment variables in your container configuration:
- `PORT` (Default: `3001`) - The port the server runs on.
- `DB_PATH` (Default: `/app/database/pokemon_cards.db`) - Location of the SQLite database.
- `POKEMON_TCG_API_KEY` (Optional) - Your API key from [pokemontcg.io](https://pokemontcg.io). While CardDexrr works without one, adding a free key increases TCG API rate limits (from 20k to 50k requests/day).
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (Optional) - Sets a known password for the auto-created `admin` account on first startup. If unset, a random password is generated and printed once to the server logs (see [First-Time Sign In](#-first-time-sign-in)).
- `CORS_ORIGIN` (Optional) - Comma-separated list of origins allowed to call the API. Defaults to the Vite dev server + same-origin. Set to your real domain when deploying.
- `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` (Optional) - Set to `true` to allow open self-registration from the login screen. Default (unset) is **invite-only**: only an admin creates accounts via the Admin panel, and the Sign Up option is hidden.
- `TRUST_PROXY` (Optional) - Set to the number of proxy hops (usually `1`) when running behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS, so `req.ip` and the rate limiters use the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For`. Leave unset when the app is directly exposed. Note: mobile camera access requires HTTPS, so a TLS-terminating proxy in front of the app is the expected production setup.

### Health check
The server exposes `GET /api/health` (no auth). It returns `200 {"status":"ok"}` when the app and database are reachable, `503` otherwise. The Docker image already wires this into a `HEALTHCHECK`.

## 🔍 Card Scanning & Match Data

Image identification matches your photo against precomputed reference features stored in `backend/data/` (gitignored — large and regenerable; not shipped in the repo). There are two tiers:

**Set-scoped MTG (recommended, no pre-build).** Enter the set code of the box you're scanning. The first scan of a new set builds that set's ORB index on demand from Scryfall (~1 min, cached under `backend/data/sets/`); every subsequent scan matches within just that set for exact-printing accuracy. Nothing to run ahead of time.

**Global / code-free matching (optional, heavy pre-build).** To identify cards without giving a set code (and to power game auto-detection), precompute the full CLIP embedding + ORB databases:

```bash
cd backend
# CLIP embeddings (recall) — per game
node --max-old-space-size=2048 scripts/build-card-embeddings.mjs --game mtg
node --max-old-space-size=2048 scripts/build-card-embeddings.mjs --game pokemon
# ORB features (geometric verification) — per game
node scripts/build-card-orb.mjs --game mtg
node scripts/build-card-orb.mjs --game pokemon
```

These download every card image and are **heavy**: several hours of CPU + downloads and ~1.6 GB on disk. Both scripts checkpoint and support `--resume`. A `POKEMON_TCG_API_KEY` (see below) is recommended for the Pokémon build. Without any of this data, the scanner still works via the OCR fallback.

> [!NOTE]
> The endpoints backing this are `POST /api/scan-match` (identify an uploaded card image) and `POST /api/prepare-set` (build/verify a set's index). The backend has no auto-reload — restart it after changing backend code so new routes/data load.

## 💾 Backup, Restore & Recovery

**Backup.** All state lives in the single SQLite file (the `carddexrr-data` volume in Docker, or `DB_PATH` locally). Two options:
- **File-level:** copy the DB file while the container is stopped, e.g. `docker run --rm -v carddexrr-data:/data -v "$PWD":/backup alpine cp /data/pokemon_cards.db /backup/`. (The app runs in WAL mode; stop the container first so the `-wal`/`-shm` files are checkpointed.)
- **Per-user data:** each user can also export their own collection from the app as CSV or JSON (Collection → Export). This is portable to other trackers but does not include other users or app settings.

**Restore.** Stop the container, drop the backed-up `pokemon_cards.db` into the volume, start again. Or use the in-app Import (CSV/JSON) to restore a single user's collection.

**Lost admin password.** The initial `admin` password is printed once, on the run that first creates the database. If you lose it and did not set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, either set that variable and recreate the database, or delete the DB file so a fresh admin is generated on next startup. There is no self-service password reset.
